# RxJava2 Kata

## Objective

You have several classes under `com.adidas.engineeringday.reactive`. They contain several 
methods which implementation is missing. You need to code the implementation so that the
tests pass. Each method contains the description of what you should implement

## How to run the tests

This is a regular Gradle project so you can run the tests with

    ./gradlew test
    
## Useful info

There's a nice decision tree in [the documentation
of ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html)
